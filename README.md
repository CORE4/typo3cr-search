TYPO3.TYPO3CR.SearchCommons
===========================

Proposal for a TYPO3CR search common package

This currently depends on https://review.typo3.org/#/c/30076/ to reduce boilerplate code that also exists in TypoScript.

If that is a blocker we can put the code in the package for now and refactor this when the change was merged (probably a good idea).
